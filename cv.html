    <h3>10/2015–<i>present</i> | <span>Telenor Digital, Bærum</span></h3>

    <section>
      <p>
        Devops engineer in the Software Telco team in Telenor Digital,
        Telenor Groups's entrepreneurship division. I am responsible
        for setting up managed AWS environments for production,
        staging and test, along with CI/CD pipelines.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Encoded infrastructure as reusable projects using Terraform.
          This allows keeping the environment setup checked into
          version control, and to easily recreate entire environments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Built a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and custom release
          tooling written in Python, allowing automatic deployment and
          test of container images to test and staging.
        </li>
        <li>
          Expanded the mobile message manager with support for
          fragmented messages for use with our proprietary GGSN.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created a test runner in Java, for building ephemeral
          CoreOS/fleet clusters using AWS EC2 instances, and then
          deploying a service stack that smoke tests are run against.
        </li>
        <li>
          Described the current architecture in the prototype setup,
          identified shortcomings and proposed a revised architecture
          for the migration to a production capable system.
        </li>

    <h2>Skills</h2>

    <h3>Programming</h3>

    <section>
      <p>
        I have nearly twenty years of programming experience and have
        enjoyed several programming languages, and like learning new
        ones.  I take pride in writing, and appreciate reading,
        aesthetically pleasing code.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Java</b> is the language I have most professional
          experience with, and I am quite familiar with its ins and
          outs, as well as several common tools and frameworks, such
          as Maven and Dropwizard.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Haskell</b> was used almost exclusively in the Wire
          backend, and I spent the better part of three years learning
          and getting productive in this marvelous programming
          language.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Python</b> is a language I have been revisiting countless
          times during my career, and is my go-to language for smaller
          jobs and prototyping.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Rust</b> is becoming one of my favorite languages as I am
          starting to appreciate its expressiveness, zero-cost
          abstractions and rich type system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Common Lisp</b> was my favorite language for a long time,
          and I have worked professionally with it on two occasions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Ruby</b> is a language that caught my attention quite
          early, and I used it for writing network management systems
          long before Ruby on Rails was invented.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Perl</b> is the first language I used professionally.
          While I have not used it for a long time, it taught me all I
          know about regular expressions.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <h3>Operational</h3>

    <section>
      <p>
        My first full time position was as a system administrator on
        Solaris, and for the past twenty years I have repeatedly been
        involved in related tasks.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Linux</b> was my desktop operating system for twelve years, and
          I am still using it on a daily basis on the server side. I
          have also been exposed to a number of other Unices, such as
          Solaris, Digital UNIX, FreeBDS, NetBSD and Darwin.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>TCP/IP</b> has always been very close to my work, be it
          when developing network management systems for large IP
          networks, or developing REST-like APIs for web services.
          Besides the fundamentals, I am familiar with protocols such
          as DNS, HTTP, SMTP, IMAP4 and SIP.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cloud services</b> is something I have been increasingly
          involved in, in particular AWS.  I have deployed services at
          scale using Ansible and Chef, and encoded complex
          environments as code using Terraform.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Containerization</b> is a new topic for me, but lately
          I have been highly involved in deploying containers on
          CoreOS/fleet, and I have been looking into more advanced
          solutions such as Kubernetes and Nomad.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <h2>Interests</h2>

    <section>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I am fond of cycling, both the athletic and mechanical
          aspects, as well as collecting funny looking bicycles and
          volunteering as a bicycle mechanic at an annual even to
          promote cycling.
        </li>
        <li>
          Since we got a garden, I have been enjoying tending it and
          growing our own vegetables, and I am currently building a
          greenhouse.
        </li>
        <li>
          I have always enjoyed programming, in particular the
          functional style, and frequently find myself tinkering with
          code on my spare time.  I also try to pass on this passion
          to the next generation by volunteering at our local Code
          Club.
        </li>
        <li>
          I like yeast, consequently I both brew my own beer and bake
          my own bread.
        </li>
